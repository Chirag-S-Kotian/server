- **File Management**: Upload, update, retrieve, and delete files securely.
- **Cloud Integration**: Stores files using **Cloudinary**.
- **Authentication Middleware**: Ensures that only authorized users can perform certain actions.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **Prisma**: ORM for interacting with the database.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database.
- **Cloudinary**: Cloud-based image and file management.
- **JWT**: For secure authentication.
- **Multer**: For handling file uploads.
- **Nodemailer**: For sending email verifications.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the backend on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chirag-S-Kotian/server.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd server
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following variables:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_database_url
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
MAIL_USER=your_email_address_for_sending_verifications
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
```

### 5. Set up the database

Run Prisma migrations to set up the PostgreSQL database:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### 6. Start the server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start running on `http://localhost:4000`.

## Usage

Once your server is up and running, you can interact with the backend via API endpoints.

### 1. **User Registration and Login**

- **Register**: POST `/api/users/register`
- **Login**: POST `/api/users/login`
- **Verify OTP**: POST `/api/users/verify`

### 2. **File Management**

- **Upload File**: POST `/api/files/upload`
- **Get All Files**: GET `/api/files`
- **Get File by ID**: GET `/api/files/:id`
- **Update File**: PUT `/api/files/:id`
- **Delete File**: DELETE `/api/files/:id`

## Environment Variables
